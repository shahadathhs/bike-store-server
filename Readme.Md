## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB** - Either set up MongoDB locally or use a cloud solution like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### **Step 1: Clone the repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:shahadathhs/bike-store-server.git
cd bike-store-server
```
Normal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahadathhs/bike-store-server.git
cd bike-store-server
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Set up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to configure the environment variables.

Example `.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/bike-store
NODE_ENV = development
```

Make sure to replace the `DATABASE_URL` with your MongoDB URI if you're using MongoDB Atlas or a different database.

### **Step 4: Run the Application Locally**

Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are set up, you can run the project:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The server will start, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Step 5: Testing the Endpoints**

To test the endpoints, you can use a tool like **Insomnia** or **Postman**. Here are some sample requests:

- **Get all products**:  
  `GET` `/api/products`

- **Add a new product**:  
  `POST` `/api/products`  
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Xtreme Mountain Bike",
    "brand": "Giant",
    "price": 1200,
    "category": "Mountain",
    "description": "A high-performance bike built for tough terrains.",
    "quantity": 50,
    "inStock": true
  }
  ```

- **Place an order**:  
  `POST` `/api/orders`  
  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "product": "648a45e5f0123c45678d9012",
    "quantity": 2,
    "totalPrice": 2400
  }
  ```
